# Raylib game editor
- Free sprite resources found here [itch.io]https://itch.io/ (not included in repo)
- This started with a desire to learn about 2D game engine
- [Raylib]https://www.raylib.com/ - 2D/3D graphics/sound/file API
## How-to
- Include a resources directory with background/knight/skeleton subdirectories
- Run `make rungame` or `make runmapeditor`
  - This thing is buggy and unfinished!!!!
- Use Mapeditor to create a map
